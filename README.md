# Third_eye_for_blinds

This code is for a device system which warn you that in front of you in this region there is an obstacle. we can use it as a path finder for blind persons.
In this project we use an ultrasonic sensor, buzzer for sound and attach them with an arduino, Thus when ultrasonic finds an obstacle in front of it, buzzer will sound.
